# Hackbright-Project
My final project is a Feel-Good Quote Generator. Below is a draft of its user flow.  

Print main menu function with quote categories and instructions to choose one or exit.
Once category is chosen, generate random quote from category's list. 
After printing quote, print instructions to continue generating quotes from that category or return to menu.
If user input is not a defined option, print an error message and return to main menu.
