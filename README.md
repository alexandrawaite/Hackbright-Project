# Hackbright-Project
My final project is a Feel-Good Quote Generator. Below is a draft of its user flow.  

Print “Welcome to my quote generator!”
Ask user for raw input - “Simply enter 1, 2 or 3 to view the kind of quote you would like to see: ”
Print menu “1 - Motivational”
“2 - Inspirational”
“3 - Spiritual”
“Press 'enter' to get another quote”
“Press 'm' to return to this menu”
Each category will have about 20 quotes and once the user chooses a category, a random quote will appear on the screen
User can then press “enter” to continue generating quotes and “m” to go back to the main menu
